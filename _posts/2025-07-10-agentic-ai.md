This two-day, hands-on workshop is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and practical skills needed to design, build, and deploy autonomous AI agents. Through a series of interactive exercises and real-world projects, participants will explore core concepts such as agent architecture, memory and context management, tool integration, and goal-directed planning.


## Duration: 

Two Days

## Target Audience:

AI/ML Engineers, Software Developers, Product Managers, Tech Enthusiasts with intermediate Python knowledge.

## Learning Objectives:

- Understand the Fundamentals of Autonomous AI Agents
- Gain Familiarity with Popular Agent Frameworks
- Design and Build Functional Autonomous Agents
- Implement Memory and Context Handling in Agents
- Develop Multi-Agent Collaboration Systems
- Apply Goal-Oriented Planning Techniques
- Address Safety, Ethics, and Evaluation
- Build and Present a Real-World Autonomous Agent

## Hands-On Activities:

Throughout the workshop, participants will engage in hands-on coding exercises and case studies. This includes:

- Building autonomous agents using frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI, with real-time task execution capabilities
- Integrating tools and memory systems (e.g., APIs, vector databases) to enhance agent reasoning and contextual awareness
- Designing and deploying a functional agent for a real-world use case
